#Create a program which performs the arithematic calculations of 2 numbers:

a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print("The sum of two numbers is: ", a+b)
print("The difference of two numbers is: ", a-b)
print("The product of two numbers is: ", a*b)
print("The quotinet is: ", a/b)
print("The modular of the number is: ", a%b)
print("The answer is: ", a//b)
print("The square of the number is: ", a**b)
